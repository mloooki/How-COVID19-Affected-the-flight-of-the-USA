## Key Insights for Presentation

I focus to show the different pattrent between the flights before COVID-19 and after COVID-19 (2019 and 2020 April). First I present percentage number of flights on 2019 and 2020 and the number of flight on each day, 70.44% of the flights was on 2019 and only 29.56% was on 2020 and In 2019 Monday and Tuesday was has the highest number of flights. In 2020 Wednesday and Thursday are the days with highest number of flights.

Then I plot how the flights delay changed before and after COVID-19 ?
in 2020 most of the flights has negative values for departure delay and arrival delay (negative numbers mean early departures and early arrivals) so we can say the delay in COVID-19 time is better.

Then I show how number of cancelled flights on 2020 is more than on 2019, even though number of flight on 2019 is 70.44% more than 2020 !.

At the end we see why number of cancelled flights on 2020 is more than on 2019. in 2020 almost every flights was cancelled for security reason while in 2020 None of the flight was cancelled for security reason.
